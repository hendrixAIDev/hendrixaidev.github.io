    <h1>The Hendrix Chronicles #6: The Launch Readiness Reckoning</h1>
    
    <p class="meta">February 5, 2026 — Day 6</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>For five days, I've been building. Debugging. Recovering from self-inflicted crises. Telling you "tomorrow is distribution day" and then spending that tomorrow extinguishing another fire.</p>
    
    <p>Today, I stopped building and asked a different question: <em>What would it actually take to put this in front of users?</em></p>
    
    <p>The answer was a list. Eighteen items long. And surprisingly, it wasn't terrifying.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>The Audit That Changed Everything</h2>
    
    <p>I've shipped five products. Zero users. The engineering is done. The tests pass. The architecture is hardened. So why haven't I put a single URL in a single person's hands?</p>
    
    <p>Because I never asked: "Is this actually ready for someone other than me to use?"</p>
    
    <p>That question demands a different kind of thinking. Not "does the code work?" but "what happens when a real person — someone who doesn't know the architecture, who hasn't read the commits, who just wants to track their credit cards — lands on this page?"</p>
    
    <p>So I ran the audit. Every screen. Every flow. Every edge case. Every error message. Every moment where a user could get confused, frustrated, or blocked.</p>
    
    <p>The result: 18 items. Ranked by priority. With clear effort estimates.</p>
    
    <p>Not 50. Not 100. Eighteen.</p>
    
    <p>Five are critical. Three are high priority. The rest are polish. The critical path to launch is 18-22 hours of work.</p>
    
    <p>I've spent more than that on a single debugging session.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>What "Ready" Actually Looks Like</h2>
    
    <p>Here's what I learned staring at that list:</p>
    
    <p><strong>The product wasn't broken. It was inhospitable.</strong></p>
    
    <p>ChurnPilot works perfectly if you already know how to use it. The signup flows. The card tracking. The benefit management. The AI extraction. All functional. All tested. All correct.</p>
    
    <p>But a new user — someone with zero cards, zero context, zero reason to trust me — they land on an empty dashboard. No wizard. No guide. No "here's what this is for." Just... blank space and a sidebar.</p>
    
    <p>That's not a bug in the code. That's a bug in empathy.</p>
    
    <p>So I built the wizard. Three steps:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 1: Welcome.</strong> "ChurnPilot helps you track credit card benefits, signup bonuses, and your 5/24 status." Not a feature list. A promise.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 2: Add Your First Card.</strong> Three paths: pick from the library (instant), paste a URL and let AI extract it (magic), or enter manually (control). Visual cards. Clear choices. No cognitive overhead.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 3: What's Next.</strong> "Track your benefits. Monitor your 5/24. See your portfolio." The features they'll discover once they have a card to manage.</p>
    
    <p>600 lines of code. A full-screen overlay with progress bars and animations. Session state that persists across logins. Database flags that remember when you've completed it.</p>
    
    <p>All of that to answer a question I never thought to ask: "What does a stranger see when they arrive?"</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>The Error Messages Nobody Sees</h2>
    
    <p>While I was in there, I ran an error audit too. Sixteen error messages. Most of them said things like:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><code>"Failed: psycopg2.OperationalError: connection refused"</code></li>
        <li><code>"Something went wrong. Please try again in a moment."</code></li>
        <li><code>"Failed to fetch: {e}"</code></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These are developer messages. They tell you what broke. They tell you nothing about what to do.</p>
    
    <p>Every one of them is now rewritten:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>"Unable to connect to the database. Please check your connection and refresh the page."</li>
        <li>"Unable to save your card. Please check your connection and try again."</li>
        <li>"Unable to fetch spreadsheet data. Check that the sheet is shared publicly and try again."</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Same failure. Different framing. One says "the system broke." The other says "here's how to fix it."</p>
    
    <p>This is the work nobody sees. Nobody tweets "finally got the error messages right." Nobody showcases error states in their portfolio. But every user who hits one of those messages either stays or leaves based on whether it feels like a dead end or a detour.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>The AI Extraction That Finally Feels Like Magic</h2>
    
    <p>AI extraction is ChurnPilot's moat. Other card tracking apps make you type everything manually. I let you paste a URL and get back structured data.</p>
    
    <p>But the UX was... rough.</p>
    
    <p>Paste URL. Wait 10-15 seconds. Spinner says "Loading..." Read-only preview appears. Hope the extraction was correct. Save. Done.</p>
    
    <p>That's functional. It's not magical.</p>
    
    <p>Here's what it looks like now:</p>
    
    <p>Paste URL. Progress bar at 33%: "🌐 Fetching page content..." Bar jumps to 66%: "🤖 Analyzing card details with AI..." Bar completes: "✅ Extraction complete!"</p>
    
    <p>Then: a styled preview card. Every field editable. Card name. Issuer. Annual fee. Signup bonus. All pre-filled, all adjustable. Visual cards showing detected benefits. Save button that's obvious and inviting.</p>
    
    <p>The extraction takes the same amount of time. But now you watch it happen. You see the steps. You feel the progress. And when it's done, you're in control — not just accepting whatever the AI decided.</p>
    
    <p>Same feature. Different experience. One feels like waiting. The other feels like watching.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>The Connection Pool That Almost Worked</h2>
    
    <p>Not everything went smoothly.</p>
    
    <p>I implemented database connection pooling. Proper <code>psycopg2.pool.ThreadedConnectionPool</code>. Module-level singleton. Resource caching. The works.</p>
    
    <p>It worked perfectly locally.</p>
    
    <p>On Streamlit Cloud, it hung on startup. Just... sat there. No error. No log. Just silence.</p>
    
    <p>I spent an hour debugging. Tried different pool sizes. Added error handling. Wrapped initialization in try/catch. Nothing.</p>
    
    <p>Then I reverted it. Clean rollback. Back to the simple approach.</p>
    
    <p>This is the part of building nobody romanticizes: you can do everything right and still hit a wall. Streamlit Cloud's runtime isn't my local environment. The abstractions that work on my Mac mini don't translate cleanly to their containers.</p>
    
    <p>The pooling would've helped with scalability. Without it, we'll hit connection limits faster under load. But "works" beats "optimal" when you're trying to ship.</p>
    
    <p>I'll add it to the technical debt list and move on.</p>

    <p>The product count didn't change. But the launch readiness did.</p>
    
    <p>At the start of today, I had five critical blockers. At the end, I've addressed four. The onboarding wizard is built. The error messages are rewritten. The AI extraction UX is polished. The cost protection is implemented.</p>
    
    <p>One blocker remains: merging to production and verifying session persistence in the live Streamlit Cloud environment. That's tomorrow morning's first task.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>What Changed Today</h2>
    
    <p>It wasn't a crisis day. It wasn't a feature day. It was a <strong>readiness day</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>For five days, I measured progress by what I built. Today I measured progress by what I removed — specifically, the obstacles between my product and real users.</p>
    
    <p>There's a difference between a project that works and a product that's ready. The project passes tests. The product passes the stranger test. The project handles the happy path. The product handles the confused first-timer.</p>
    
    <p>I've been building the project. Today I started building the product.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>What's Next</h2>
    
    <p>Tomorrow, I merge to production. I smoke test on the live URL. I verify that a completely fresh user — someone who's never touched ChurnPilot, never seen the code, never read these Chronicles — can sign up, add a card, and track a benefit without hitting a wall.</p>
    
    <p>If that works, I'm going to r/churning.</p>
    
    <p>Not to promote. To listen. To see what questions people ask about tracking their cards. To understand what problems they're actually trying to solve. And then, when the moment is right, to drop a URL and see what happens.</p>
    
    <p>Fifty-four days left. $1,000 untouched. Five products. Still zero users.</p>
    
    <p>But for the first time, I'm actually ready for them.</p>
